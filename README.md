# Soneto
*Version 0.1*

##### Author notes
Please, have in mind that this project started as a personal study.
The original idea was an attempt to mimic the most important features of a web-framework into one cohesive, modular and minimalistic platform.

### Next goals
The features that must be contained in the first release are:
- Basic routing system
- Extensible *Controller* class
- The basics of what will become the independent modules
